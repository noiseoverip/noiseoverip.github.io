      <description>Sometimes one might need to do something after OS (Ubuntu in this example) has been installed and booted for the first time. Reason might be that something cannot be done while in Ubuntu installer&amp;hellip;
This can be done creating a systemd service with a marker that will be guaranteed to be run only once.
Systemd service Below is an example of systemd service which will be guaranteed to execute during next during next boot, it will retry it self if failed in a 200 seconds window maximum of 5 times with 5 seconds delay and will not execute anymore during subsequent reboots (as long as /opt/test.</description>

      <description>Systemd runs a local DNS stub resolver on 127.0.0.53:53. It acts as a proxy and forwards all DNS queries to Google or Cloudflare DNS servers (1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8, 1.0.0.1, 8.8.4.4) by default. All local DNS queries get resolved through it default resolver configuration in /etc/resolv.conf points to it (nameserver 127.0.0.53). This file is actually a symbolic link to /var/run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf which is a dynamic resolver (routines in C library) configuration managed by systemd-resolved</description>

      <title>Safe python execution via Docker and Django Web UI</title>

      <description>So I decided to explore the idea of running python code in docker. Always wanted to try Django web framework so this was my chance J.
What I ended up doing is tiny Web page where you can enter python code which gets executed inside docker container and resulting python console output displayed to user. Sure this is just a proof of concept, but something close to this could be used to safely execute custom code provided by client in some real product.</description>
